# Montana-Speech-and-Debate
The Montana speech and debate community sought to improve the efficiency and fairness of assigning judges to rounds during tournaments. With challenges such as manual scheduling, frequent errors, and uneven distribution of assignments, a System Analysis and Design project was initiated to develop a streamlined solution. The project involved designing a system that automates judge assignments based on criteria like availability, conflicts of interest, and expertise. By optimizing the process through clear workflows and robust algorithms, the system would reduce scheduling errors, balanced judge workloads, and ensured smoother tournament operations, benefiting both organizers and participants.
